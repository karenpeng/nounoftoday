#Yoda Newz

Newz, Yoda tells you, yessssss.

Yoda Newz is a terminal like website, in which you can query news by date. Yoda will tell jokes sometimes.

It's also a twitter bot @yodanewz, which tweets a piece of newz every night.

So how does Yoda select news?

Hummm...it actually chooses between new york times, hacker news and reddit shower thoughts. No one knows which one he's gonna choose tonight!

All the newz are saved in a database for user to query from the website.
